divisorbound.py:
Computes a constant with which d(n) = O(n^(1/8)). Here, d(n) denotes the number of divisors of n. The strategy is devised from Terry Tao's blog

prime_count.py:
Draws numbers randomly from the range (0-10^10) until a prime is picked. Compares this number with the estimate given in Stirling's approximation
